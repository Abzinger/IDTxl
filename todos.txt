check how errors and custom error classes work
the Ragwitz criterion uses the scalar values in time to check the prediction 
    -> is this correct or should we look at the next *state* in time
the Ragwitz function in TRENTOOL always embeds the same point, using different 
    historys -> do we need to do that?
